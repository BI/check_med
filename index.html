<a id="the-checkmed-application" class="anchor" href="#the-checkmed-application" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The “CheckMed” Application</h1>

<p>CheckMed URL: <a href="http://ads_bpa_rfq_test.barquinlab.com/">http://ads_bpa_rfq_test.barquinlab.com/</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>This repository contains Barquin International’s response to the GSA RFQ 4QTFHS150004 for the establishment of Multiple Award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for Agile Delivery Services (ADS I).</p>

<p>The requirement for this engagement is to use the open-source APIs from the openFDA initiative provided in the solicitation. Based on this requirement, the Barquin Team collected user stories from a variety of potential users, people not involved with the prototype development.</p>

<p>Grounded on the user stories and data analysis, we have developed “CheckMed,” a prototype web application that provides drug/ medication safety information for pregnant and nursing mothers and their caregivers. </p>

<p>We believe this application has an important potential since it enables pregnant and nursing mothers, or other interested parties, to search for drugs/ medications they are taking or considering taking and quickly locate highlighted safety information extracted from the FDA’s Enforcement (recalls), Labeling and Adverse Events data sources. CheckMed has been developed using responsive layouts that automatically adjust to screen size and device, including  workstations, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>

<h2>
<a id="functionality" class="anchor" href="#functionality" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Functionality</h2>

<p>CheckMed offers the following functionality:</p>

<h3>
<a id="search" class="anchor" href="#search" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search</h3>

<p>An easy to locate type-ahead search box is offered to the user for drug/medication search. The fields are displayed and searchable in sequence using brand name, generic name, and manufacturer name for convenient identification.</p>

<h3>
<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<a id="continuous-integration-system-l" class="anchor" href="#continuous-integration-system-l" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Continuous Integration System (l)</h3>

<p>Tools used for continuous integration are: git &amp; github, circle-ci, Docker Registry and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. See the "Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Specification" section for details: <a href="https://github.com/BI/octo-wookie/blob/master/_install_and_run/install_and_run.md">https://github.com/BI/octo-wookie/blob/master/_install_and_run/install_and_run.md</a></p>

<a id="configuration-management-system-m" class="anchor" href="#configuration-management-system-m" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration Management System (m)</h3>

<p>We are using Docker, Docker Hub and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for configuration management. Application dependencies and application code are packaged and built into a Docker image. That image is then tagged with the git commit id and pushed to the Docker Hub repository. </p>

<p>During the deployment step, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk then pulls down the Docker image and injects into it environment variables so that the application runs in Production mode. By using the container deployment approach, we are effectively proving version control on both the application source code and external dependencies.</p>

<h3>
<a id="continuous-monitoring-n" class="anchor" href="#continuous-monitoring-n" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Continuous Monitoring (n)</h3>

<p>For continuous security monitoring of our application hosting platform, we used CloudCheckr which integrates with our Amazon Web Services(AWS) account to provide the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitors the amount of money spent on infrastructure and identifies idle resources, underutilized resources, and mis-matched Reserved Instances.<br>
</li>
<li>Monitors and reports on resource utilization, spanning everything from EC2 instances to S3 and all other AWS services.</li>
<li>Using its 300 proprietary Best Practices, it ensures that we are using AWS in an optimal manner.</li>
<li>Provides the security, audit, and visibility tools to help fulfill HIPAA, PCI, FISMA Moderate, and other major compliance frameworks. It also provides auditability for assets, users, and configurations.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have deployed CheckMed using Docker and AWS ElasticBeanstalk. When all autotests have passed, our Continuous Delivery workflow builds a Docker image based on the Dockerfile, and then pushes that image up to Docker Hub. A deployment file is then sent to Elastic Beanstalk which then downloads the Docker image, starts it, and deploys the running container.</p>
